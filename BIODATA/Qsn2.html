      <p><u>About Myself</u></p>
      <p style="font-size:30px;color:white;">Before talking about myself, let's see this once.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="about">
      <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Imagine this kid. He is not very popular, but once someone becomes friends with him, they would never forget him.
      He isn't the strongest guy, but he always tries to keep smiling no matter the situation. He isn't a genius or knows everything, but he is smart enough for people to be impressed.
      He doesn't have the most peaceful life, but still he tries to help others when they need his help. He doesn't care about money but only cares about happiness.
      He doesn't want to change the world or revolutionize it but just wants to make it a better place. He isn't a dumb guy who can't understand complex things but he just loves simplicity.
    </div>

    <p style="font-size:30px;color:white;">Okay that's all. Imagined him? If yes, then you already have an idea about me. Now, talking about myself, I wouldn't say much but just a few words. <br><br>I am PSKPK. :)</p>
